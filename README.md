# practice_data_challenges

This repository cotains practice data challenges that I've worked on. They are a work in progress as I improve them whenever I find a nice bit of code. I generally spend more than the alloted time on these because I use them as an opportunity to learn about and apply methods that are new to me.

All of these challenges are from exercises that I've done at Insight Data Science. Because I don't know where they originated and if they are free or paid for I have not uploaded the actual data files here.
